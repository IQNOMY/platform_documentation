Website parameters

.. image:: _static/images/WebsiteParameters.png

Parameters in URLs
++++++++++++++++++

When we track URLs as a pagevisit. There are a lot of parameters in these urls.

Parameters are the key/values in an url. A parameter is recognized by ?, # or &. Most of the parameters are only there for the website functionality and don't have any meaning for the page url. If you strip them from the URL the page will still show the same page. If a parameter is stripped from the URL, IQNOMY can recognize a pagevisit from different visitors as the same pagevisit.

Example:

* visitor 1 visits http://www.iqnomy.com/?gclid=iowerSDferr435345iwssRFDWERWE
* visitor 2 visits http://www.iqnomy.com/?utm_campaign=google

Actually both visitor visit the page: http://www.iqnomy.com. We have stripped the two parameters to recognize this as the same page. Sometimes the parameter does make a difference in the recognition of the page. Therefor you can configure what to do with the parameters on this page.

Standard IQNOMY has a preconfiguration of found parameters on your site, but you can change the setting for your organization.

After stripping the trackingURL from parameters the 'real' URL is available. This URL is stored as a '[[Resources|Resource]]'.

Type actions
++++++++++++

These are the actions that can be done with a parameter.

With the example of, http://www.iqnomy.com?utm_campaign=google, the type actions are checked.

remove
   http://www.iqnomy.com will be stored as the visited page

store separate and remove
   http://www.iqnomy.com will be stored as the visited page and utm_campaign=google will be stored with this pagevisit.

store separate and keep
   http://www.iqnomy.com?utm_campaign=google as the visited page and utm_campaign=google will be stored with this pagevisit.

store separate and keep, clear value
   http://www.iqnomy.com?utm_campaign= as the visited page and utm_campaign=google will be stored with this pagevisit.

search argument
   http://www.iqnomy.com will be stored as the visited page and utm_campaign=google will be stored as a question with this pagevisit.

keep
   http://www.iqnomy.com?utm_campaign=google as the visited page

found by iqnomy
   http://www.iqnomy.com and the utm_campaign=google will be stored with this pagevisit automatically.

Parameter overview
++++++++++++++++++

.. image:: _static/images/ParameterOverview.png

Parameter name
   The parameter name found in a tracked URL.

Type
   The 'type action' shows what will be done with the parameter and value when the IQNOMY platform will recognize this in the URL from a pagevisit.

Usage count
   This will only count when a parameter is only found by IQNOMY and no 'type action' is attached to this parameter.

Actions
   If you click Sample urls a popup will show.


Example urls
++++++++++++

.. image:: _static/images/ParametersExampleURL.png

This shows the first 5 urls with this parameter. You can get an impression about how the parameter is used and where it is used.

Edit parameters
+++++++++++++++

.. image:: _static/images/ParameterEdit.png

If the Add button is clicked in the screen the parameter is added to the list. Make sure you always click 'save' at the end of the screen to save all your changes.

Delete will delete the parameter from the list, but when the parameter is found with the tracking it will pop up in this list again!

Website URL manipulation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Type of manipulation
The best way to show this is with some examples. http://www.iqnomy.com/accountinformation/login.php?username=christianvriens

* Delete everything after part of URL: Value=login.php. The URL will become: http://www.iqnomy.com/accountinformation/login.php
* Delete part of URL and everything after: Value=accountinformation. The URL will become: http://www.iqnomy.com/
* Delete everything after start: Value=http://www.iqnomy.com/accountinformation/. The URL will become: http://www.iqnomy.com/accountinformation/

Value
   This is the text that is used for the manipulation recognition. See example above.

Add button
   To add a rule always click add before you click the save button.

Save!
   Don't forget to click save if you have added new rules

IP-access
=========

.. image:: _static/images/IpAccess.png

Now it is possible to filter IP address in the following ways: - No filtering - CDrop all except - Accept all except In addition, you now have a range of IP addresses specified using a subnet mask.
Example 1: IQNOMY office externally (clients 193.172.34.65 t / m 193.172.34.78)
* IP Address: 193.172.34.64 Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.240
Example 2: a specific IP address
* IP address: 193.172.34.66 subnet mask: 255.255.255.255 Even IPv6 addresses can be specified.
Example 3: a specific IPv6 address
* IP address: fe80 :: c0f3: 5b08: 37d9: 6e90 subnet mask: fe80 :: c0f3: 5b08: 37d9: 6e90
Example 4: IPv6 range
* IP address: fe80 :: Subnet Mask: fe80 ::

In the maintenance screen of IP filters, you can test whether a specific IP address is allowed based on the set filter method and network. If IP ranges are set in which each IP address explicitly mentioned, they may better be replaced by a new filter with a subnet mask. http://www.subnet-calculator.com/
