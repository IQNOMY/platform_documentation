   Profile
     The profile is based on a unique identification together with properties and connected eventproperties that can be grouped by an session

Connect your id with the IQNOMY profile
=======================================

If you want to recognize a visitors profile based on your id. You can connect your id with the iqnomy profile. This way you can use your id to identify the visitor.

It works two ways:

* IQNOMY can use the information you have with your id in the IQNOMY profile. 
* Based on your ID you can extract information from the IQNOMY platform.

Examples for your ID can be:

* emailid from the emailmarketing system
* your CRM id
* the login id from your website

###################
Add data to profile
###################

You can add information into the IQNOMY profile of your visitor.

Examples can be:

* Extra information from your CRM
* Emailmarketing information
* SEA information
* SEO information

If you send an emailmarketing newsletter, put extra information into the links of you newsletter. This can be an example of the productcategory, age of the receiver, name of the receiver, etc. Example: http://www.iqnomy.com/blog/?name=christian. In this example the IQNOMY profile now knows the name of the visitor.

Get profile data
################

There are three ways to get a profile out of IQNOMY:

#. :ref:`Liquid Internet <profile-in-lc>`
#. :ref:`REST api <apidoc>`
#. :ref:`Active profile hooks <hooks>`


The main way to get the profile information from IQNOMY is by letting IQNOMY send this information to you. This can be done as a response on an action of a visitor or at the end of a session. 

Containers can also be used to get the IQNOMY profile, but this method is less used. Companies use this method if they want this information realtime available in the CMS for personalisation.


The extraction of the IQNOMY profile can be done through containers:

* The container will show liquid content
  * HTML
  * Javacript
  * JSON
  * XML

You can use liquid content that you define in the IQNOMY platform. Based on the visitors profile IQNOMY will show you the right content. You can also use build in liquid content that will show the profile of the visitor. This way you can request the container through REST or javascript with your own profile ID to get the profile information for your CRM.
