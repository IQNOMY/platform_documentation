Multidimensional view
=====================

The visitors on your website are anonymous. All the effort to get with SEO visitor to your website and then...their all the same anomymous visitor. The only this website statistics provide your is: which page is visited, were did 'they' leave the website, etc.

With the multidimensional view of your visitor you can actually see an individual visitor and visitor groups.

Now you can use Liquid Internet to target these groups.

Dimension
=========
Every organisation can create it's own dimensions. These dimensions will used to view these groups of visitors on the website. IQNOMY has a selflearning technology that let the visitors train the dimensions with there own scenarios. Defining visitor scenarios is past, because we can recognize these scenarios from what the visitors are doing on the website. Customer behavior is only part of this technology. Referrerpages, questions, content, etc. are being used to train this analysis.

We have standard dimensions an organisation can use to get this visitor information. But an organisation can also define it's own dimensions. This depends on the marketing strategy with the website. What does an organisation wants to know about its visitors.

These dimensions are seen in the realtimedesk, on individual level if you look into a visitor or in analysis about groups of visitors.

You can create dimensions in the MyLiquidSuite application.

3 types dimensions:

* Standard dimensions: you can activate them, but can't change them.
* Basic dimensions: custom dimensions based on last 10 pagevisits events.
* Advanced dimensions: custom dimensions that can be configured by an IQNOMY consultant.

Standard dimensions
===================

Standard dimensions can be used to benchmark within your industry. If another company in your industry is also using one or more standard dimensions IQNOMY automaticly starts a benchmark. A standard dimension is always created by IQNOMY. You can request a standard.

Based on our experience we created have two types of standard dimensions. A user can choose to use a standard dimension for its liquid account.

* Dimensions that don't need extra data.
* We need extra standard data so the dimension can be calculated. If you are feeding IQNOMY with this data the dimension can be calculated
