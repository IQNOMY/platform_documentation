If you implement the script also read

*[[Tracking integration with website]]
*[[Filter IQNOMY]]

=Standard tracking script implementation=

Standard implementation of the script can be done by a webmaster. He will implement the script in the source code of your website. Normally this is done in a website template. 

 The script will only work when implemented on every page where you want to follow visitors.

==BODY script==
Make sure the BODY script is placed in between the body tags. Normally a tracking script is being implemented just before the </body>.

 Every BODY script has a customer specific number! Yours is in the email you receive after registering a MyLiquidSuite.
==Check if the script is implemented==
If the standard script is implemented you can check this yourself by opening your website in you browser. Right-click your mouse and open 'source website'. 

When you see the source of your website you can check by search in this txt for 'iqnomy'. If you search in the txt for 'iqnomy' this will show you the BODY-script. 

If IQNOMY tells you that you are still not connected check if the number in the BODY-script is the same as the number in [[Integration_on_own_website]]. Still problems then email us at [mailto:support@iqnomy.com support@iqnomy.com]

=Implementation Google's blogger.com=

A lot of blogs are registered on Google's blogger.com.

If you login you will have a URL like http://''yourname''.blogspot.com. When adding your site in IQNOMY register the site ''blogspot.com''. We use this to verify your script. At the moment we can only verify domainnames and not subdomains like yourname.blogspot.com. After registering at IQNOMY you will receive your own script by email to put on your blog. IQNOMY will then follow the visitors only on your blog. 

To put the script into you blogspot blog. 

==Step 1==

Login your blogspot and click on 'design'.

==Step 2==

Put the IQNOMY script into the HTML code.
 We couldn't edit our sjablones in the browser. Therefore we had to download our blogspot sjablones.
 Put the script in and upload again. I don't know if this is a bug in blogspot. 
===Header script (used in old version IQNOMY)===
After uploading it looks like this (part of the script in the <head>):
