There are several options to show the 'Recommendated Products' on the site. The way which is used most often, is to personalized the main banner and to inject an empty div. Below you see an image of www.ikbenzomooi.nl. If there is no visitor profile yet, the website visitor will see the default homepage. The div 'Voor jou geselecteerd' will not be shown. If the website visitor has a interest profile the banner and products that are interested for that person are shown.
